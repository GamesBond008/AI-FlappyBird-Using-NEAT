The Classic Game of Flappy Birds Which You can play and also Can Train The AI To learn The Game

I know i'm not the first one to do it But Wanted To take this challenge to do it. And in the process of creating The flappy Bird i learned The Various Sections
Game Desiging, Neural Networks, GUI etc
## Setup
Install Python 3.6 or above and the Install The Following Modules using Pip:
1. Tkinter
2. Pygame
3. neat-python
After That just Clone The Repository And Run The FlappyBirds.py File :)
## Status
Currently i haven't added The Audio. I'm gonna do it later When i get the time. Except That the game runs Fine and as well as AI.
## Note
The Training sometimes take 2-3 minutes while sometimes it take 20-30 minutes it depends Heavily on rng so that's Why we added The Feature Fast Mode If you Press Space While Training the AI The game ticks at much higher Rate Thus Decreasing The Time It takes to Train.
